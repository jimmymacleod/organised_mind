Heroku Link : Missing

Organised Mind  

The site is a simple journaling tool. The app is supposed to be easy to use and handy for quick note taking and moments of rumination. There is a note section and task section, along with a daily journaling tool. Notes and Tasks are assigned to days but can also exist in isolation.

I tried to use a couple of frontend gem such as a carousel, but couldn't get the installation to work. Spent a couple hours playing around with these but failed in the end to get any to work.

I would have liked to have got around to including some more gems or API's but spent the time trying just to get a simple version of the app together.

There are a bunch of small bugs in the app but nothing that 'breaking';

- No admin support.
- Cannot delete users etc.
- Notes link on day page deosnt link to right page.
- Notes and Tasks show page is not formatted.
- 'Miscellaneous' should not be present if there were no items to display.
- Home links are inconsistent.
